- **Content analysis** is a general term for a number of different strategies used to analyse text (Powers & Knapp, 2006). It is a systematic coding and categorizing approach used for exploring large amounts of textual information unobtrusively to determine trends and patterns of words used, their frequency, their relationships, and the structures and discourses of communication (Mayring, 2000; Pope et al., 2006; Gbrich, 2007).
- The** purpose of content analysis** is to describe the characteristics of the document's content by examining who says what, to whom, and with what effect (Bloor & Wood, 2006).
- On the other hand, **thematic analysis** often is seen as a poorly branded method, in that it does not appear to exist as a named method of analysis in the same way that content analysis does.
- **Thematic analysis** as an independent qualitative descriptive approach is mainly described as “a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes) within data” (Braun & Clarke, 2006: 79). It has also been introduced as a qualitative descriptive method that provides core skills to researchers for conducting many other forms of qualitative analysis. In this respect, qualitative researchers should become more familiar with thematic analysis as an independent and a reliable qualitative approach to analysis.
