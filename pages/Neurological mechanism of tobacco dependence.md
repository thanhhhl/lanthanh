- **The Role of Mesoaccumbens Dopamine in Nicotine Dependence **
	- The mesoaccumbens projection neurons are regarded as a central node in the brain networks that regulate drive and hedonic experience, and their dysregulation is a common pathophysiological step in addictive behaviors as well as major depression.
	- Positron emission computed tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are unique among imaging techniques in the ability to measure speciﬁc molecules in the brain.
	- They have revolutionized our ability to measure chemicals in the brains of living people.
	- Brain chemicals, including receptors present in low concentrations (nM–pM range), are measured using “trace” doses of highly speciﬁc radioactive drugs (called radiotracers) and imaged with a PET or SPECT camera.
	- The primary addictive chemical in tobacco smoke, nicotine, activates β2*-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β2*-nAChRs).
	- Although there are other combinations of subunits that assemble to form nAChRs (see chapter entitled Structure of Neuronal Nictinic Receptors; volume 23), the β2*-nAChRs are pivotal (e.g., they are critical for the reinforcing effects of nicotine), and so this site has been a primary point of interest for radiotracer imaging in the smoking ﬁeld
	- In addition, when nicotine activates β2*-nAChRs located on mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons in the **ventral tegmental area**, this results in neuronal ﬁring and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (Imperato et al. 1986).
	- **The ventral tegmental area (VTA)** is a hub of the mesocorticolimbic circuitry that plays a significant role in reward, motivation, cognition, and aversion. Dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which make up 65% of neurons in the VTA, have been the primary focus of research into this brain region.
	- Both β2*-nAChRs and DA signaling are critical neurosubstrates underlying tobacco smoking behaviors and dependence.
	- In this chapter, we will review the imaging literature that has provided insights into the molecular mech- anisms of tobacco smoking with a focus on studies examining β2*-nAChR avail- ability and DA neurotransmission.
- **Imaging beta 2*-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors - Preclinical Studies**
	- The nAChRs that contain the β2*-subunit are critical for mediating the effects of nicotine in the brain including the reinforcing effects (Picciotto et al. 1998), dopamine release (Epping-Jordan et al. 1999; Koranda et al. 2013), sensitivity to nicotine (Cosgrove et al. 2010; Marubio et al. 1999; Tritto et al. 2004), and the incentive aspects of motivation (Brunzell et al. 2010) (see chapter entitled The Role of Mesoaccumbens Dopamine in Nicotine Dependence; this volume).
	- Preclinical studies administering nicotine at various doses and routes of administration to rats, mice, and monkeys—as well as postmortem human studies—have all indicated that nicotine and tobacco smoke result in signiﬁcantly more β2*-nAChRs throughout the brain compared to saline (animals) or to not smoking (humans).
- **Imaging beta 2*-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors - Imaging the Upregulation of beta 2*-nAChRs in Tobacco Smokers**
	- In order to help the subjects quit smoking, we used contingency man- agement techniques (Staley et al. 2006). In the ﬁrst paper, we demonstrated that tobacco smokers at 7–9 days of abstinence have signiﬁcantly higher β2*-nAChR availability in the cortex, striatum, and cerebellum compared to a group of age- and sex-matched nonsmokers (Fig. 2).
- **Imaging beta 2*-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors - Imaging the Normalization of beta 2*-nAChRs in Tobacco Smokers**
- The postmortem study (Breese et al. 1997) indicated that smokers who had quit smoking at least two months prior to their death had β2*-nAChRs levels similar to controls.
- However, smokers in the study had quit anywhere from 2 months to 30 years prior to their death, so the study did not shed light on the acute time course of receptor changes (e.g., during acute withdrawal in the ﬁrst few months of abstinence, when relapse rates are high…
- In our next study, we imaged β2*-nAChR changes over the ﬁrst few months of abstinence in tobacco smokers (Cosgrove et al. 2009). As shown in Fig. 2, at one day of abstinence, nicotine is still present in the brain blocking the radioligand from binding to the receptor and there is no difference in β2*-nAChR availability com- pared to the group of nonsmokers. At one week of abstinence, there is higher β2*-nAChR availability in smokers compared to nonsmokers consistent with the previous study (Staley et al. 2006). Then even at 2 and 4 weeks of abstinence, receptor availability remains high and does not return to nonsmoker control levels until 6–12 weeks of abstinence.
- This study (Cosgrove et al. 2009) and others (Brody et al. 2013b; Mamede et al. 2007) demonstrate that upregulation of β2*-nAChRs is initially persistent, but that β2*-nAChRs normalize over approxi- mately 6–12 weeks of abstinence from cigarettes and all other nicotine-containing products.
- These brain changes parallel the clinical course of smoking cessation in which craving, relapse, and withdrawal symptoms slowly dissipate over the ﬁrst few months of abstinence even though relapse may occur months or years after the last cigarette.
- The type of cigarette smoked modulates the degree of upregulation. Cigarettes containing menthol, which are used by up to 1/3 of smokers, lead to higher β2*-nAChR availability than non-menthol-containing cig- arettes (Brody et al. 2013a).
- As it inhibits nicotine metabolism
  6
  At one week of abstinence, β2*-nAChR availability in the sensorimotor cortex was nega- tively correlated with the urge to smoke to relieve withdrawal symptoms (Staley et al. 2006). At four weeks of abstinence subjects with higher β2*-nAChR avail- ability in the cerebellum reported both a greater desire to smoke and a greater urge to smoke to relieve withdrawal…
- 6
- This suggests that magnitude of upregulation may play a role in craving over the course of abstinence and that managing the time course of the normalization may help individuals who are more likely to relapse in response to high levels of craving.
- 6
  At four weeks of abstinence subjects with higher β2*-nAChR avail- ability in the cerebellum reported both a greater desire to smoke and a greater urge to smoke to relieve withdrawal (Cosgrove et al. 2009).
- 6
- …it is possible that nicotine replacement strategies may be effective because they continue to activate β2*-nAChRs. This leads to continued upregulation and the individual can “wean” the receptors off of nicotine as the dose of nicotine is decreased over time.

  1 Imaging Tobacco Smoking with PET and SPECT - 2 Imaging beta 2*-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors - 2.5 Nicotine Occupancy of beta 2*-nAChRs
- In addition to receptor changes, imaging studies have informed our knowledge about what happens in the brain after someone smokes a cigarette. For example, after one puff of a cigarette, approximately 50 % of all β2*-nAChRs in the brain are occupied by nicotine. After smoking one or two cigarettes, the receptors are saturated, so up to 100 % of β2*-nAchRs are occupied by nicotine (Brody et al. 2006a; Esterlis et al. 2013).
- 7
- We know that nicotine doesn’t clear the brain immediately, and in fact dependent smokers have a slower process of nicotine accumulation going into the brain from a cigarette than do nondependent smokers (Rose et al. 2010).
- 7
  Both of these ideas—rapid accumulation and puff-associated spikes of nic- otine—had been proposed to explain the maintenance of tobacco dependence.
- 7
- So with a slow kinetic proﬁle and with most receptors in a smoker occupied by nicotine throughout the day, why do people keep smoking?
- 7
- People smoke for many different reasons, and nicotine reinforcement is only one component.
- 7
- The reinforcement or pleasure derived from nicotine, like many other drugs of abuse, is necessary in driving the initial phases of drug-seeking behavior.
- 7
- However, as the addiction progresses, many people may continue to smoke in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms and due to the many conditioned cues that have become ingrained, which are a part of the compulsive, repetitive nature of tobacco smoking.
- 7
  Thus, while nicotine is the primary addictive com- ponent of tobacco smoke, there are additional compounds such as MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors that likely play a role.
- 7
- Other imaging studies have demonstrated that even smoking a denicotinized cigarette, which supposedly has very low nicotine content, leads to occupancy of

- Di Chiara and Imperato performed the seminal study showing that drugs abused by humans release DA in the nucleus accumbens of the rat brain (Di Chiara and Imperato 1988).

  1 Imaging Tobacco Smoking with PET and SPECT - 3 Imaging Dopamine Release in Response to Nicotine and Tobacco Smoking - 3.2 Imaging Dopamine Release with PET
- Nicotine increases synaptic dopamine levels, and the dopamine binds to the D2/3 receptors which reduce the number of available binding sites for the radiotracers which also bind the D2/D3 receptors.
- 9
- The change in number of available receptors from the baseline scan to the scan after the drug challenge is an indirect measure of increased dopamine levels
- 9
- Striatal dopamine release has been reliably measured using stimulants such as amphetamine or tobacco smoking with radiotracers such as [11C]raclopride PET or [123I]IBZM SPECT (see Laruelle 2000 for review).
- short for corpus striatum.
  9
- For all of the dopaminergic radiotracers, drugs such as amphetamine robustly increase synaptic DA.

- Although nicotine is a less robust DA releaser compared to amphetamine, there are many studies that have examined nicotine and tobacco smoking-induced DA release in human subjects.

  We conﬁrmed the postmortem study and demonstrated that smokers with schizophrenia do have higher β2*-nAChR avail- ability than nonsmokers with schizophrenia; however, the difference was restricted to fewer regions than we have found in otherwise healthy smokers.
- 14
- Critically, we found that smokers with schizophrenia who have lower β2*-nAChR availability report more negative symptoms and perform worse on tests of executive control.

- This is important because there are medications available to treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), but there are no effective medications for the negative symptoms (e.g., anhedonia and ﬂat affect) that signiﬁcantly impair quality of life.

  2 Behavioral Mechanisms Underlying Nicotine Reinforcement - Abstract
- Behavioral Mechanisms Underlying Nicotine Reinforcement
- We have hypothesized that nicotine has two effects on reinforcement; it increases the probability of responses resulting in nicotine delivery (primary reinforcement) and enhances the apparent reward value of non-nicotine reinforcers (reinforcement enhancing effect).
  19
- The behavioral actions of nicotine are complex and extend well beyond the actions of the drug as a primary reinforcer.
- 19
- Stimuli that are consistently paired with nicotine can, through associative learning, take on reinforcing properties as conditioned stimuli.
- 19
- These conditioned stimuli can then impact the rate and probability of behavior and even function as conditioning reinforcers that maintain behavior in the absence of nicotine.
- 19
- Nicotine can also act as a conditioned stimulus (CS), predicting the delivery of other reinforcers, which may allow nicotine to acquire value as a conditioned reinforcer.
- 19
  Nicotine directly enhances the reinforcing efﬁcacy of other reinforcing stimuli in the envi- ronment, an effect that does not require a temporal or predictive relationship between nicotine and either the stimulus or the behavior.

- 2 Nicotine Self-administration
- 21
- The gold standard for studying the reinforcing properties of drugs in experimental animals is self-administration in which animals need to perform a behavioral task (e.g., press a lever, poke their nose into a hole) to obtain the drug.
  21
  2 Behavioral Mechanisms Underlying Nicotine Reinforcement - 2 Nicotine Self-administration - 2.1 Outcome Measures
  The reinforcing effects of nicotine are affected by a number of important mod- erating variables. For example, the duration and route of administration of nicotine delivery and the sex and age of subjects impact the reinforcing properties of nic- otine and are highly relevant when considering the reinforcing properties of tobacco products.

  …the bulk of the reinforcing actions of nicotine in typical self-administration procedures cannot be explained as primary reinforce- ment alone. The next section will begin to dissect the role of environmental cues and their importance for maintaining smoking behavior.
- 32
- 4.1 Conditioned Responses to Nicotine-Associated Stimuli
- 32
- As a result of Pavlovian conditioning, stimuli paired with nicotine can elicit CRs (Pavlov 1927).
- 32
- A typical Pavlovian conditioning preparation involves an existing reﬂexive relationship between a stimulus (unconditioned stimulus, US) and response (unconditioned response, UR).
- 32
- In this case, nicotine (US) results in a wide range of behavioral and physiological changes (UR).
- 32
- Following one or more pairings, the originally neutral stimulus elicits a CR in the absence of the US and is now called a CS.
- 32
- In this case, any environmental stimulus that is consistently predictive of nicotine may come to serve as a CS and elicit a CR.
- 32
- In an operant procedure, the CS might be a light or a tone paired with nicotine delivery (provided the cue does not initially by itself elicit the response).
- 32
- In the context of cigarette smoking, the look or feel of a cigarette, the taste of tobacco, lighters, the cigarette pack, the smoking corner outside of the ofﬁce, the effects of alcohol, certain friend groups,

- etc., might all function to elicit CRs, even in the absence of subsequent nicotine delivery, because they have previously been repeatedly paired with nicotine.
- 33
- 4.2 Nicotine-Associated Stimuli as Conditioned Reinforcers
- 33
- Because smoking stimuli have been paired with nicotine, and nicotine functions as an unconditioned (i.e., primary) reinforcer, these cues can come to reinforce behavior on their own (i.e., become conditioned reinforcers).

  2 Behavioral Mechanisms Underlying Nicotine Reinforcement - 4 Associative Learning and the Influence of Stimuli Predicting the Effects of Nicotine - 4.4 Individual Differences in Associative Learning Effects
  In two studies, smokers were asked to smoke cigarettes with very low nicotine contents. In a study con- ducted in an in-patient hospital unit, there was a decrease in smoking behavior when smokers switched to these low-nicotine cigarettes (Donny et al. 2007).
- 35
- However, smoking behavior did not change when a similar study was conducted in the natural environment (Donny and Jones 2009).
- 35
- It may have been easier for smokers to learn that smoking no longer resulted in nicotine delivery in a completely novel context than the natural environment in which smoking behavior had a long history of being reinforced across many contexts (Conklin 2010; Wray et al. 2011).
- 35
- 4.4 Individual Differences in Associative Learning Effects
- 35
- Sex may be another determinant of cue effects.
- 35
- On average, women are more likely to be affected by smoking cues than men, who may be more directly inﬂuenced by nicotine (Perkins 2009; Perkins et al. 2002).
- 35
  However, preclinical work does not support this idea. One study evaluated cue- induced and nicotine-primed reinstatement in male and female rats (Feltenstein et al. 2012). There were no sex- or estrous cycle-dependent differences between male and female rats.

  2 Behavioral Mechanisms Underlying Nicotine Reinforcement - 6 Reinforcement-Enhancing Effects of Nicotine
- 5 Associative Learning and the Inﬂuence of Nicotine as a Predictor of Other Reinforcers
- 36
- In these experiments, nicotine signals that one behavior will be reinforced and another will not. Relatedly, humans can learn to engage in one response if they receive nicotine nasal spray and another response if they receive saline spray (Perkins et al. 1994).
- 36
- Researchers have extended this ﬁnding to show that nicotine, when paired with a reinforcer, even when it is not contingent upon behavior, can increase the rate of behavior directed at the location of reinforcer delivery (i.e., goal tracking; Besheer et al. 2004).
- 36
  The role of nicotine as a predictor of other reinforcers in acquiring or main- taining smoking behavior is unclear.
- 36
- Drugs such as alcohol, marijuana, and caffeine are frequently co-used with nicotine. Smokers who have a cigarette with their morning coffee may associate nicotine with coffee and enjoy cigarettes even on mornings when they choose decaffeinated coffee.
- 36
- 6 Reinforcement-Enhancing Effects of Nicotine
- 36
  The primary reinforcing effects of nicotine and the consequent associative and con- ditioned reinforcing properties of nicotine are important in driving smoking behavior, but additional non-associative effects of nicotine on reinforced behavior may be equally important.
- 36
- Nicotine potentiates the reinforcing properties of other rewards. This latter effect occurs independent of any predictive relationship between nicotine and either the other stimulus or the target behavior (Caggiula et al. 2009).

  2 Behavioral Mechanisms Underlying Nicotine Reinforcement - 7 Summary and Conclusions
- 7 Summary and Conclusions
- 43
- Nicotine reinforcement is remarkably complex and requires understanding of both associative and non-associative mechanisms well beyond the primary reinforcing effects of the drug itself.
- 43
- From an associative perspective, environmental stimuli that predict nicotine delivery can become conditioned stimuli eliciting CRs that increase the probability of smoking.
- 43
- They will also become conditioned reinforcers through their pairing with nicotine, an unconditioned reinforcer, and will reinforce smoking behavior on their own.
- 43
- Contextual stimuli can become discriminative stimuli, increasing the probability of engaging in smoking behavior.
- 43
- Nicotine can also enter into associative relationships through its pairing with other reinforcing stimuli in the environment and consequently function as a CS or as a conditioned reinforcer, both of which may increase the likelihood of engaging in smoking behavior.
- 43
- From a non-associative perspective, nicotine, like other psychostimulants, can directly impact reinforcement from other stimuli in the environment.
- 43
  This effect is particularly robust with nicotine and has been emphasized in the “dual-reinforce- ment” model, which posits that nicotine maintains self-administration behavior as a primary reinforcer and a reinforcement enhancer (Caggiula et al. 2009; Donny et al. 2003).
- 43
- The reinforcement-enhancing properties of nicotine have been observed in experimental animals across age and sex, and, more recently, conﬁrmed to impact behavior in humans.
- 43
  Responding for both unconditioned reinforcers (sensory stimuli, food reward) and conditioned reinforcers (nicotine and non-nicotine rela- ted) can be enhanced by nicotine.

  In sum, self-administration of nicotine in humans and the rodent model is sus- tained by three main actions:

- (2) nicotine can establish conditioned reinforcers in the environment through associative processes; and (3) nicotine can potentiate the incentive valence of other stimuli with reinforcing value.
