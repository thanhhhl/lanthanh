- **Negative reinforcement:** Deciding to take an antacid before you indulge in a spicy meal is an example of negative reinforcement. You engage in an action in order to avoid a negative result. One of the best ways to remember negative reinforcement is to think of it as something being subtracted from the situation. #reinforcement
- **Positive reinforcement:** the process of encouraging or establishing a pattern of behaviour by offering reward when the behaviour is exhibited.
