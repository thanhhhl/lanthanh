- Although social factors impact smoking substantially in humans, ﬁndings from nonhuman subjects in controlled experiments provide support that sex differences in nicotine/tobacco addiction have a biological basis.
- 268
- Differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of nicotine or the effect of gonadal hormones may underlie some but not all sex differences observed.
- 268
- Literature ﬁndings suggest that including sex as a factor in nicotine/tobacco-related studies will improve our success rates in individually tailored smoking cessation programs.
- 268
- In human subjects, although the dissimilar inﬂuence of social and environmental pressures on males and females cannot be overlooked, biological factors are also evident and suggest similarities to the differences observed in animal models of addiction.
- 269
  Women have greater vulnerability for smoking-related diseases (speciﬁcally my- ocardial infarction and lung cancer) than men, but are less successful in quitting smoking (Harris et al. 1993; Zang and Wynder 1996; Thun et al. 2002; Henschke and Miettinen 2004; Henschke et al. 2006).
- 270
- Men beneﬁt from nicotine replacement therapy more than women (reviewed by Perkins 2001).

- 2 Nicotine Metabolism
- 270
  There are conﬁrmed sex differences in some biological parameters such as body weight, body fat, plasma volume, gastric emptying time, plasma protein levels, cy- tochrome P450 activity, drug transporter function, renal processes, and excretion activity; all these factors underlie differences in pharmacokinetics (bioavailability, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) of drugs (see chapters by Benowitz, and by Mwenifumbo and Tyndale, this volume)…

- Pharmacotherapy for Tobacco Dependence
- 487
  Pharmacological aids to smoking cessation can be life-saving, because they generally double the probability of successful tobacco abstinence, enabling more people who may have been previously unsuccessful at quitting to achieve lasting abstinence. Pharmacotherapy is also among the most cost-effective forms of medi- cinal therapy…
- 488
- 1.1 Treatment Goals and Mechanisms of Action
- 488
- What is commonly referred to as tobacco addiction or tobacco dependence has been clinically delineated into two speciﬁc diagnosable disorders: dependence and
- 488
- withdrawal (American Psychiatric Association 2000; World Health Organization 1992).
- 489
- Dependence refers to the maladaptive, chronic, and typically relapsing use of tobacco that meets the same types of criteria that are applied to other forms of drug dependence.
- 489
  Withdrawal refers to the generally time-limited syndrome that oc- curs upon termination of drug use, is varied across drug classes, and is frequently, but not always, present in dependent persons.
- 489
  For tobacco, withdrawal symptoms in- clude anxiety, anger, difﬁculty in concentrating, sleep disturbance, and weight gain (Hughes and Hatsukami 1986).
- 489
- Powerful recurring cravings are also prominent.
- 489
  The mechanisms of medication action that support smok- ing cessation appear to vary across treatment approaches, and may include reduced withdrawal symptoms including cravings and cognitive deﬁcits, reduced reinforc- ing effects of smoking, and provision of at least some of the beneﬁts derived by smoking, such as control of mood and appetite control…
- 489
- For example, as discussed in the next section, nicotine replacement medications reduce withdrawal symptoms by partially replacing the nicotine normally provided by smoking.
- 489
- Antidepressants such as bupropion and nortriptyline may be efﬁcacious for smoking cessation, in part because of their reduction of the cessation-induced depression that is related to nicotine withdrawal.
- 489
  The high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity associated with cigarette smok- ing is notable.
- 489
- One study found that rates of current daily smoking among psychiatric inpatients were 83% for patients with schizophrenia and 65% for patients with mood disorders, compared to 26% for community controls (de Leon et al. 2002).
- 489
- Among adolescents, those with clinically signiﬁcant ADHD symptoms were 2.8 times more likely to be daily smokers than those who did not display these symptoms (Tercyak et al. 2002).
- 489
  There are a number of neural mechanisms by which a medication may allevi- ate withdrawal symptoms, simulate some of the reinforcing effects of nicotine, or block the reinforcing effects of nicotine.
- 489
  The most obvious is the nicotinic recep- tor itself, where nicotine replacement medications act.
- 489
- …given that many of the effects of nicotine in the brain are likely mediated through modulation of a range of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamate, GABA, norepinephrine, and serotonin (Picciotto 1998), one might be able to mimic or block some of the reinforcing effects of nicotine by selectively activating or blocking these neurotransmitters.
- 489
- As discussed by Lerman et al. (2007), there are a variety of animal and human models that have been proposed to facilitate the drug development process, which include models that study the positive reinforcing and rewarding effects related to nicotine dependence, as well as the negative-reinforcing effects (i.e., alleviation of tobacco withdrawal). Models of positive reinforcing and rewarding effects include models of self-administration, drug reward, and conditioned reinforcement/reward…
- 490
  Negative reinforcement models include models of withdrawal and relapse (rodent models of nicotine physical dependence and withdrawal are reviewed in detail else- where; see the chapter by Malin and Goyarzu, this volume).
- 490
  In addition, drug dis- crimination models can be used to further examine the effects of potential medica- tions for smoking cessation (e.g., whether a drug produces effects similar to nico- tine), or reduce the discriminative stimulus properties of nicotine.
- 490
- 2 Nicotine Replacement
- 490
  Nicotine has been shown to be the main active ingredient in tobacco that causes and sus- tains addiction to tobacco (US Department of Health and Human Services 1988).
- 490
- Nicotine administration has been shown to reverse the nicotine withdrawal seen upon discontinuation of chronic nicotine exposure in rats (Malin et al. 1992) and humans (West et al. 1984; Henningﬁeld et al. 1986).
- 490
  At the time of the early develop- ment of NRTs, substitution therapy using methadone had been used for decades as a treatment for opioid dependence (Charnaud and Grifﬁths 1952; Kreek 1979), with the understanding that partial blockade of opioid reinforcement was one aspect of
- 490
- methadone’s mechanism of action (Donny et al. 2002).
- 491
  Currently approved NRT products include the transdermal nicotine patch and several acute NRT products, including nicotine gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, va- por inhaler, and nasal spray.
- 491
- 2.1 Sustained Dosing Formulation: Transdermal Patch
- 491
  There are currently four patch formulations on the market in the USA and many other countries that vary in their design, pharmacokinet- ics, and duration of wear (i.e., 24- and 16-h wear).
- 491
  All of the patch types are available in a range of dosages, and progressively lower doses are used to provide weaning over a period of several weeks or longer, to enable gradual adjustment of the body to lower nicotine lev- els and, ultimately, to a nicotine-free state.
- 492
- Importantly, nicotine patches do not seem to provide protection against acute craving provoked by smoking-related stimuli.
- 492
- 2.2 Acute Dosing Formulations
- 492
- There are several options available to smokers that, unlike the nicotine patch, allow them to self-administer a dose of nicotine on an “as needed” basis.
- 492
- These include nicotine gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, oral inhaler, and nasal spray.
- 492
- All of these products, except the nasal spray, deliver nicotine through the oral mucosa.
- 492
  Acute- dosing products have the beneﬁt that both the amount and timing of doses can be titrated by the user.
- 492
- Theoretically, therefore, smokers with more nicotine tolerance or greater need can get a higher nicotine dose, and smokers who are experiencing acute adverse effects can scale back their intake.
- 492
  Control over the timing of self-dosing is key to the use of acute dosing prod- ucts, because it enables smokers to use NRT as a “rescue medication” when they encounter particularly strong cravings or threats to abstinence.
- 492
  These episodes of “breakthrough craving” are typically provoked by situational stimuli, such as see- ing someone smoke or experiencing emotional upset (Sayette et al. 2000).
- 492
  Some ini- tial reductions in craving are likely due to the behavioral effects of medication use, such as the act of chewing the polacrilex gum (Cohen et al. 1997).
- 492
  The ﬁrst acute dose NRT that was made available to consumers was transmu- cosally delivered nicotine polacrilex (“nicotine gum”); the gum is available in two doses: 2 and 4 mg, delivering approximately 1 and 2 mg, respectively (Benowitz et al. 1987). In highly dependent smokers, the 4-mg is superior to the 2-mg gum (Tonnesen 1988; Herrera et al. 1995).
- 493
- About 50% of the nicotine in gum is absorbed (Benowitz et al. 1987).
- 493
- Since smokers take in approximately 1 mg of nicotine per cigarette (Benowitz and Jacob 1984), a smoker using 2-mg gum would have to use as many gums as cigarettes.
- 493
  A newer nicotine lozenge, available in 2- and 4-mg formulations has been approved in the USA, Europe, and Australia.
- 493
- One advantage of the lozenge compared to gum is that chewing is not required.
- 493
  Also, the amount of nico- tine absorbed per lozenge is somewhat higher than that delivered by gum, because all of the nicotine in the lozenge is delivered unless the lozenge is taken out of the mouth.
- 493
- Nicotine delivery is related to the number and depth of inhalations.
- 494
  Labeling states that 80 deep puffs of the inhaler deliv- ers 4 mg of nicotine; fewer or shallower puffs will deliver correspondingly smaller amounts of nicotine.
- 494
  Moreover, the amount of nicotine absorbed from the inhaler is temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures delivering larger amounts of nico- tine and lower temperatures delivering smaller amounts (Lunell et al. 1997).
- 494
- Nicotine nasal spray is marketed as a pharmacy-only medication in the UK, and is available only by prescription in the USA.
- 494
  The nasal spray was designed to de- liver doses of nicotine to the smoker more rapidly than other NRT products.
- 494
  A true pulmonary inhaler, unlike the currently available nicotine inhaler (which actually delivers nicotine into the mouth for buccal absorption), would deliver nico- tine to the lung in a manner more comparable to cigarette smoking.
- 494
  Signiﬁcant barriers to devel- opment of a pulmonary inhaler are the potential for abuse, and the regulatory impli- cations that would follow from a system that delivers pulmonary nicotine at levels comparable to that delivered by a cigarette.
- 494
- 2.3 Combination Products
- 495
- One strategy for further improving the efﬁcacy of existing NRT medications is to combine one medication that allows for passive nicotine delivery (e.g., transdermal patch) with another medication that permits acute libitum nicotine delivery (e.g., gum, nasal spray, inhaler) (Sweeney et al. 2001).
- 495
- The rationale for combining NRT medications is that smokers may need both a slow delivery system to achieve a constant concentration of nicotine to relieve tonic cravings and tobacco withdrawal symptoms, as well as a faster-acting preparation to function as rescue medication for immediate relief from breakthrough cravings (Sweeney et al. 2001).
- 495
- Clinical trials suggest incrementally increased efﬁcacy of the patch plus gum, compared to either product alone (Fagerstrom et al. 1993; Kornitzer et al. 1995; Puska et al. 1995).
- 495
- Less research is available on combinations of the patch and other acute NRT formulations, but several studies suggest that combinations with other acute dosing forms also provide a clinical beneﬁt, as would be expected (Blondal et al. 1999).
- 495
- On the other hand, bupropion in combination with the nicotine patch appears to be more efﬁcacious than the nicotine patch alone (Jorenby et al. 1999), possibly because the two medications act via different pharmacological mechanisms.
- 495
  The complexity of obtaining approval for combination medications, combined with the difﬁculty of marketing combination products, has slowed attempts by manufacturers to gain regulatory approval for combination ther- apies (Fiore et al. 2000).
- 495
- 3 Nicotine Partial Agonists
- Or protagonist, a substance which initiates a physiological response when combined with a receptor.
  497
  Nicotine acts at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which exists in a va- riety of subtypes, depending on the protein subunits from which they are comprised (Gotti et al.
- 497
  Nicotine is a full ago- nist at these receptors.
- 497
- Varenicline is a partial agonist (Mihalak et al. 2006).
- 497
- A partial agonist is a compound that, even at high doses, does not produce the same response as a full agonist.
- 497
- Because there is a ceiling on the effects of a partial agonist, it is plausible that a partial nicotine agonist would have a lower risk of adverse events and have a lower abuse potential than a medication containing nicotine.
- 497
- Phase III clinical trials showed signiﬁcantly greater continuous abstinence rates in patients administered varenicline, compared to placebo or bupropion SR.
- 497
  Varenicline also showed an acceptable safety proﬁle, with nausea, insomnia, ab- normal dreams, and headaches being the most commonly reported adverse effects (Gonzales et al. 2006; Jorenby et al. 2006).
- 497
- 4 Nicotine Antagonists
- A substance which interferes with or inhibits the physiological action of another
  497
  Mecamylamine is a noncompetitive antagonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine recep- tor site.
- 497
- If mecamylamine could effectively block the physiological and reinforcing effects of cigarette smoking, this should, in theory, lead to eventual extinction of the behavior.
- 497
- There is some evidence that mecamylamine may be useful for some recalcitrant smokers as a smoking cessation aid (Tennant et al. 1983).
- 498
- However, the side effects of the medication (hypotension, constipation) may limit its utility.
- 498
- Targacept is currently developing enantiomers of mecamylamine for the treatment of depression, which may have a more favorable safety proﬁle than mecamylamine.
- 498
- Mecamylamine in combination with nicotine transdermal medication has been investigated as a smoking cessation aid, and may produce better cessation outcomes than nicotine alone.
- 498
- 5 Nicotine Vaccines
- 498
  A vaccine against nicotine induces antibodies that can bind nicotine molecules in plasma, theoretically before the drug reaches the neural receptors that pro- duce effects normally associated with smoking.
- 498
  Because vaccines reduce the amount of nicotine, and speed at which the nicotine reaches the brain and neural receptors, it would be predicted that the reinforcing effects of nicotine would be reduced substantially. This was supported in one study, which found that immuniza- tion with a nicotine vaccine prevented the nicotine-induced increase in dopamine release in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, a biochemical correlate to the re- warding properties of nicotine (de Villiers et al. 2002)…
- 498
- 6 Drugs Modulating Monoamine Neurotransmitters
- 500
- By selectively activating these neurotransmitters, one might be able to mimic some of the reinforcing effects of nicotine.
- Reinforcement is defined as a consequence that follows an operant response that increase (or attempts to increase) the likelihood of that response occurring in the future.
  500
- Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant drug that is the only nonnicotine-based prescription medicine approved for smoking cessation by the FDA. Its mechanism of action is presumed to be mediated by its capacity to block neuronal reuptake of dopamine and/or norepinephrine (Fiore et al. 2000)…
- 500
  Relative to other antide- pressants, bupropion has a relatively high afﬁnity for the dopamine transporter (Baldessarini 2001).
- 500
  There is also evidence that bupropion acts as a functional nico- tine antagonist, suggesting another potential mechanism by which bupropion could reduce smoking rates (Slemmer et al. 2000).
- 500
- Animal studies demonstrate that bupropion alters the reinforcing and withdrawal effects of nicotine. Low doses of bupropion reduce the rewarding effects of nicotine and the affective and somatic symptoms of withdrawal, as well as place aversion conditioned to nicotine withdrawal (Cryan et al. 2003; Malin et al. 2006).
- The brain reward system is a brain circuit that causes feelings of pleasure when it's “turned on” by something we enjoy (see figure), like eating good food or being in love. Whenever this reward circuit is activated, our brains note that something important is happening that's worth remembering and repeating.
  500
  Another study examined the effects of bupropion (5–40 mg kg −1) on the reinforcing prop- erties of nicotine and food in rats, under two different schedules of reinforcement (Bruijnzeel and Markou 2003). The authors found that pretreatment with the high- est dose of bupropion (40 mg kg −1) resulted in a 50% reduction of nicotine intake in rats self-administering 0.03 mg kg −1per infusion of nicotine under a ﬁxed- ratio (FR) schedule.
- 500
  However, pretreatment with bupropion did not affect the self- administration of nicotine under a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule.
- 500
- 7 Dopamine D3 Receptor Antagonists
- 501
- 8 α 2-Noradrenergic Agonists
- 502
- Clonidine is an α 2-noradrenergic agonist used in the treatment of hypertension.
- 502
  Clonidine has been shown to diminish symptoms of both opioid and alcohol with- drawal (Gossop 1988; Mayo-Smith 1998).
- 502
- …one study of heavy smokers who had failed in previous quit attempts found, at the end of the 4-week treatment, that those treated with clonidine had twice the rate of abstinence as those treated with a placebo (Glassman et al. 1988). This effect continued through the 6-month follow-up. These results suggest that clonidine may be efﬁcacious in the treatment of tobacco dependence, but the conditions under which it is most appropriately used are not well deﬁned.
- 502
  The most common side effects of clonidine are constipation, dizziness, drowsi- ness, dryness of mouth, and unusual tiredness or weakness.
